One bedroom, large, can fit multiple beds. Is very clean, two bathrooms available (only one is for the bedroom though, the other is downstairs.). Location is great, near many subways, and the view is beautiful.
Two bedrooms available, one bed each, medium size, can fit 4 people fairly comfortably. It's pretty clean here, but occasionally bad smells from the outside will seep into the room. Air conditioned, since it's very hot outside.
Three bedrooms available, one bed each, medium size, can fit up to 8 people fairly comfortably (some people might have to sleep on the floor, but it's very comfy and carpeted). Beds are clean, with fresh bedsheets and covers before you come. Has a great view of the outdoors, gets a lot of natural sunlight.
Four beds available in one room, can fit six to eight people depending on how much you squeeze. It's clean and tidy.
Massive bedroom, one King size bed, has its own bathroom and jacuzzi as well. Will give you experience in living a life of luxury.
